Due to licensing, CarrotCakeCMS will not be distributing third party binaries in its binary releases
these instructions are to provide the end user of CarrotCakeCMS of obtaining the needed system libraries
if they do not have Visual Studio 

CarrotCakeCMS depends on the .NET framework 4.5 and a number of third party libraries to work
Instructions follow for obtaining those libraries

obtain the nuget commandline tool from https://dist.nuget.org/index.html
	https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/latest/nuget.exe


recommend adding a config file in the same directory as nuget.exe and place in computer's %PATH% 
or use full path (ex c:\nuget\nuget.exe ) to reference
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5730412/error-when-running-the-nuget-exe-command
		
you may encounter Shim errors for the .NET Framework version and platform support:
	https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2715633
	
	------- nuget.config ----------
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<configuration>
	<startup>
		<supportedRuntime version="v4.0"/>
	</startup>
</configuration>
	-------------------------------

usage tips:
	https://docs.nuget.org/consume/command-line-reference
	http://blog.davidebbo.com/2011/01/installing-nuget-packages-directly-from.html
	
go to a temporary location that you wish your packages to be downloaded into ex c:\tmp
copy the packages.config from CarrotCakeCMS into this directory (see project CMSAdminMVC if not found in the binary zip archive)

go to a command line / DOS prompt after configuring nuget.exe
and run the command

-------------
nuget install packages.config
-------------

or, you can grab the packages individually at your option

-------------

nuget install EntityFramework -Version 6.1.3
nuget install Antlr -Version 3.5.0.2 
nuget install Newtonsoft.Json -Version 7.0.1 

nuget install Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc -Version 5.2.3 
nuget install Microsoft.AspNet.Web.Optimization -Version 1.1.3
nuget install WebGrease -Version 1.6.0

nuget install Microsoft.AspNet.Identity.EntityFramework -Version 2.2.1
nuget install Microsoft.AspNet.Identity.Owin -Version 2.2.1

nuget install Microsoft.Owin.Host.SystemWeb -Version 3.0.1 
nuget install Microsoft.Owin.Security.OAuth -Version 3.0.1 
nuget install Microsoft.Owin.Security.Cookies -Version 3.0.1 
nuget install Microsoft.Owin -Version 3.0.1
 
-------------
etc


take all the DLLS and place in the CarrotCakeCMS \bin\ directory
tip: use windows file explorer and 
find "file:net40"
select all, then delete
find "file:net20"
select all, then delete
find "file:net35"
select all, then delete

then do a "file:*.dll"
select all then copy 

you may need to cherry pick some files out such as the versions of Newtonsoft.Json.dll and you don't strictly need EntityFramework.PowerShell.dll

you are looking to get all the DLLs that fall under the <LIBRARYNAME #.#.#.#>\lib\net45 path of all the subdirectories

your DLLs should include all of the following
	** anything that starts as CarrotCake.CMS.Plugins*.dll can be considered optional unless expecting that feature to run **

	Antlr3.Runtime.dll
#	CarrotCake.CMS.Plugins.PhotoGallery.dll	** optional C3 plugin 
	Carrotware.CMS.Core.dll
	Carrotware.CMS.Data.dll
	Carrotware.CMS.DBUpdater.dll
	Carrotware.CMS.Interface.dll
	Carrotware.CMS.Mvc.UI.Admin.dll
	Carrotware.CMS.Security.dll

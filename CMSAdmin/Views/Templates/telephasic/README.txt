This is Telephasic, a brand new site template for HTML5 UP. It features a sharp, modern
design inspired by omfg everything, and makes good use of SVGs to ensure stuff looks
nice and crispy on retina displays.

Demo images* are courtesy of Felicia Simion, an amazing photographer with an
incredible portfolio over at deviantART:
